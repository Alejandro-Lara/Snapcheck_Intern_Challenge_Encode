# Snapcheck_Intern_Challenge_Encode

  This is my attempt at the coding challenge for the SnapCheck Software Engineer Intern - Java, MongoDB, RabbitMQ
position application.

The encode() function I wrote fulfills the outlined requirements.
Note about implementation: At first I was going to implement the encryption chart's rows and columns as a 2d array,
but I eventually realized that the encryption pattern was strightforward enough to skip making the chart. If my understanding
of the pattern is correct, then the row amount is not even necessary either.
I hope that the creation of the "chart" was not mandatory for the challenge.
